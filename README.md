# Locus
Locus is a location based social media app, just like any other social media you can make friends with anyone by searching and sending them friend request. On home screen there is a map showing your currrent location and your friends location who are online, there will also be GO ONLINE and GO OFFLINE button. On GO ONLINE press, LOCUS algorythm will calculate and do things and if it finds any of your frineds within 5km of your current location, it will send you an notification as "Your friend VISHAL is nearby, Tap to contact". This function is performed every 5 minutes with your app in background, you dont need to keep the app open. This is my first project, i hope it helps thank you. Feel free to contact.
I have used Firebase realtime database and firebase storage for data and images.
